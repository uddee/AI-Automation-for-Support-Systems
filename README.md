## Project Overview

The **AI & Automation for Support Systems** project is designed to:
- **Automate customer support** through an AI-powered chatbot.
- **Analyze user feedback** using machine learning techniques, predicting issues such as bugs, performance issues, or feature requests.
- **Categorize and prioritize support tickets** based on customer descriptions, ensuring that critical issues are resolved promptly.

### Components:
1. **AI-Powered Chatbot**: A simple rule-based chatbot for automated customer support, capable of handling basic queries.
2. **Feedback Analysis**: A machine learning model using **Naive Bayes** to categorize feedback and predict common issues (e.g., bug, performance).
3. **Ticket Categorization & Prioritization**: A model that categorizes support tickets and assigns priority levels to improve support workflows.

## Features

- **AI Chatbot**: Provides automated responses for common issues and queries.
- **Machine Learning for Feedback**: Uses **Naive Bayes** to predict issues based on user feedback.
- **Ticket Categorization**: Automatically categorizes and prioritizes support tickets.
- **Scalable and Customizable**: Easily extendable to include more advanced features, such as NLP-based models or deep learning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Pip package manager

### Steps to Install:
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Automation-Support-Systems.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AI-Automation-Support-Systems
    ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. If you need to install **NLTK** for the chatbot or **scikit-learn** for the machine learning models, use:
    ```bash
    pip install nltk scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

### AI-Powered Chatbot

1. Start the chatbot by running the following script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

2. Once the script is running, you can interact with the chatbot in the terminal by typing messages such as "hello", "not working", "help", or "crash". Type `quit` to exit the conversation.

### Feedback Analysis and Issue Prediction

1. Run the feedback analysis script to train the model and predict issues based on new feedback:
    ```bash
    python feedback_analysis.py
    ```

2. Example of predicting feedback issues:
    ```python
    new_feedback = "The app crashes when trying to load the homepage"
    predicted_issue = predict_feedback_issue(new_feedback)
    print(f"Predicted Issue: {predicted_issue}")
    ```

### Ticket Categorization and Prioritization

1. Run the ticket categorization and prioritization script:
    ```bash
    python ticket_categorization.py
    ```

2. Example of categorizing a support ticket:
    ```python
    ticket_description = "Payment gateway not working"
    response = automated_ticket_response(ticket_description)
    print(f"Automated Response: {response}")
    ```

│
├── chatbot.py                              # AI-powered chatbot implementation
│   └── Contains the chatbot logic using the NLTK library. The chatbot interacts with users, responding to common issues and queries such as "help", "not working", "crash", etc.
│
├── feedback_analysis.py                     # Feedback analysis and machine learning model
│   └── Contains machine learning models to analyze user feedback. Uses Naive Bayes classifier to predict the type of issues (bug, performance, feature request) based on the feedback provided.
│
├── ticket_categorization.py                 # Ticket categorization and prioritization
│   └── Classifies incoming support tickets, automatically categorizing them and assigning priority levels based on their content. Uses text classification techniques to improve workflow and response times.
│
├── requirements.txt                        # List of required Python packages
│   └── A text file listing all Python libraries required for the project (e.g., `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `flask`, etc.). It allows easy installation of dependencies using `pip`.
